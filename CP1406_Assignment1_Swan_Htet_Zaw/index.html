        <h2>Prevention first, for a healthy smile</h2>

          <div>
            <p>
              At 100SMILES Dental Care we believe prevention is always better than cure.
              Regular check-ups, professional cleans and X-rays help us detect issues early,
              before they become painful or expensive problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              During your visit we also discuss nutrition, daily brushing and flossing,
              and any changes you have noticed in your mouth or gums. Our goal is to help
              you feel confident about your smile and your long-term oral health.
