  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Swan Htet Zaw</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to increase the number of preventive dental
    appointments (check-ups, cleans and the Annual Dental Check-up package) booked by new and
    returning patients by at least 20% over the next six months. The site will achieve this by clearly
    presenting the clinic’s services, highlighting current discounts, and making it quick and easy for
    local families in Razole to contact the clinic by phone or email to book an appointment.
  </p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The clinic will evaluate the website’s success by tracking outcomes that are directly linked to this
    goal. First, staff will compare the number of preventive appointments (check-ups, cleans and
    Annual Dental Check-up packages) in the six months before and after the website launch. Second,
    reception staff will record how many patients book through the email link or mention the website
    when they contact the clinic. Third, a short survey at reception will ask new patients how easy it
    was to find information and make a booking online. If preventive appointment bookings and email
    enquiries increase by at least 20%, and most surveyed patients report that the site is easy to use,
    the website will be considered successful.
  </p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The primary target audience is local families living in or near Razole, including parents or carers
    aged roughly 25–60 who organise dental care for their families, as well as older adults and
    retirees who need regular check-ups. Many of these users are busy, may feel nervous about dental
    visits, and often browse on mobile phones. To suit this audience, the site will use a calm blue and
    white colour scheme, friendly photos showing children, adults and older patients, clear headings
    and short sections of text, plus a simple navigation menu that appears the same on every page.
    The phone number and email address will be prominent on all pages, with clear calls-to-action
    such as “Book your visit” to encourage contact and bookings.
  </p>

  <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
  <p>
    The website will contain four main pages: Home (index.html), Services (services.html), Our Team
    (our-team.html) and Contact &amp; Hours (contact.html). The flowchart shows the Home page at the
    top with links to the other three pages, and arrows between all pages to represent the consistent
    navigation menu. Each page is represented by a single box, and the order of the boxes matches
    the order of links in the navigation bar: Home, Services, Our Team, Contact &amp; Hours.

  </p>

  <h2>WireFrames</h2>
  <p>
    Wireframes are used to plan the layout of each page before building the final site. For this
    project, a separate wireframe has been created for the Home, Services, Our Team and Contact &amp;
    Hours pages. Each wireframe shows a header with logo and navigation, the main content areas,
    space for key images and a footer with contact details. The Home page wireframe includes a
    large hero image, a short introduction to the clinic and a section for special offers. The Services
    wireframe groups services into clear sections so visitors can quickly scan what is available. The
    Our Team wireframe presents staff photos with short profiles. The Contact &amp; Hours wireframe
    focuses on address, trading hours and contact details, with a clear call-to-action to book an
    appointment.
